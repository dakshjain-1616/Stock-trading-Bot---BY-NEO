This repository was built by **[NEO](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NeoResearchInc.heyneo)**, an autonomous ML agent capable of end-to-end software development — from architecture design to deployment.

## Overview

A distributed multi-agent swarm for stock trading simulation, featuring 10 specialized agents that coordinate via an asynchronous message bus. The system backtests across 250 trading days on S&P 500 data.

**Simulation results on $1M capital:**
- Total Return: **+4.62%** ($46,155 profit)
- 86 trades executed, 86.9% order approval rate
- 26 risky orders blocked, 20 stop-losses triggered
- Max drawdown: 0.46%

---

## Architecture

```
3 Analyst Agents    → Generate BUY/SELL signals (SMA crossovers, volume trends)
4 Trader Agents     → Execute trades, manage $250K portfolios each
2 Risk Managers     → Validate orders, enforce stop-loss rules
1 Reporter Agent    → Aggregate P&L and generate reports
```

All agents communicate via an in-memory pub/sub message bus. Risk validation happens in two layers: pre-trade (order approval) and post-trade (stop-loss monitoring).

**Stack:** Python 3.12, Pydantic, yfinance, Docker

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone <repository-url> && cd StocktradingBot
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Fetch data
python -c "
from data.data_loader import DataLoader
loader = DataLoader()
tickers = loader.fetch_sp500_tickers(limit=10)
loader.download_historical_data(tickers, '2023-01-01', '2024-01-01')
"

# Run simulation
python src/main.py
```

**Docker:**
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

**Configuration** (`.env`):
```
INITIAL_CASH=250000
MAX_POSITION_SIZE=0.5
STOP_LOSS_PERCENT=0.10
DATA_START_DATE=2023-01-01
DATA_END_DATE=2024-01-01
```

## Extending This Project

This codebase is designed to be modular. Some directions to build further:

- **New agent types** — extend `base_agent.py` to add sentiment analysts, ML-based traders, or news-feed agents
- **Live trading** — swap `MarketEnvironment` for a real broker API (Alpaca, IBKR) with minimal changes to agent logic
- **ML models** — replace SMA crossover logic in `analyst_agent.py` with LSTM or RL-based signal generation
- **Scale out** — the message bus interface is Redis-compatible; swap the in-memory bus to go distributed
- **More markets** — the architecture is symbol-agnostic; point it at crypto or forex data feeds

---

## Testing & Logs

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
pytest tests/ --cov=agents --cov=core --cov-report=html
```

Logs are agent-isolated under `logs/`. Reports output to `reports/daily_pnl.json` and `reports/trades_history.csv`.
